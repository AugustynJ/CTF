# SFI CTF

Capture The Flag Competition organized on Students' IT Festival in Kraków.

## hello_world

You’ve got a message!
The flag is:

**sfi18_ctf{hello_world!}**

Nothing to do.

## cryptic_website

![cryptic_website](./images/cryptic_website.png)

You can jest copy text and paste somewhere. This gives you flag:

**sfi18_ctf{HelloThere!}**

## crawlers

Conctent gives us hint about robots many times:

> “Dear time traveler,
You HAVE TO destroy the time machine! It is dangerous for DeLorean to exist. Don’t try to find me in the past, or future, or any other dimension. As a scientist, I tried to explore time and space, but it only led to dangerous paradoxes. The future is not meant for people just yet. Please, don't let anything stop you. There may be some people or robots who would love to take over this technology. Doc Emmet Brown”

> Try to find what robots Doc was talking about! Maybe they have a message for you that will clarify this further.

We can search in internet:

*A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site*

Therefore, we should find file *robots.txt*. It is on [ctf.sfi.pl/robots.txt](ctf.sfi.pl/robots.txt)
